-- Options are automatically loaded before lazy.nvim startup
-- Default options that are always set: https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim/blob/main/lua/lazyvim/config/options.lua
-- Add any additional options here

-- vim.lsp.enable

-- I added `localoptions` to save the language spell settings, otherwise, the
-- language of my markdown documents was not remembered if I set it to spanish
-- or to both en,es
-- See the help for `sessionoptions`
-- `localoptions`: options and mappings local to a window or buffer
-- (not global values for local options)
--
-- The plugin that saves the session information is
-- https://github.com/folke/persistence.nvim and comes enabled in the
-- lazyvim.org distro lamw25wmal
--
-- These sessionoptions come from the lazyvim distro, I just added localoptions
-- https://www.lazyvim.org/configuration/general
vim.opt.sessionoptions = {
  "buffers",
  "curdir",
  "tabpages",
  "winsize",
  "help",

  "folds",
  "localoptions",
}

-- Most of my files have 2 languages, spanish and english, so even if I set the
-- language to spanish, I always add some words in English to my documents, so
-- it's annoying to be adding those to the spanish dictionary
-- vim.opt.spelllang = { "en,es" }

-- I mainly type in english, if I set it to both above, files in English get a
-- bit confused and recognize words in spanish, just for spanish files I need to
-- set it to both
vim.opt.spelllang = { "en" }
